Thank you for visiting our little online shop!
We are a small team with a big passion to share our love of books.
Please bear with us as we process your orders.

## How to Order
Once you've chosen something, be sure to reserve it by filling out this **[Google Form](https://forms.gle/yebh3XHyuUqe7xG8A)**

You will receive an invoice including the details of your order, confirming that it has been reserved under your name.

We will then reserve it in your name for the next 24 hours, during which we await your payment.


## Payment Methods

We accept payments through **GCash**, **PayMaya** and **Bank Transfer**.
Shipping fees are excluded.
This will be shouldered by the buyer.

Note that we will only process your orders and ship them once your payment is verified.
Give us **at least 24-48 hours** to confirm your payments.
Once confirmed, we will process your order right away!

If, after 24 hours, no payment was made, the chosen book will be up again for the public.
